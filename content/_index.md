I am an Australian composer originally from Perth, Western Australia. I enjoy creating musical systems that vivify the behaviours of computers and machines, at times involving other musicians in this process. A primary interest of mine is to embrace the complexity and non-human nature of modern computing as an integral feature of my work’s aesthetic. These creations often assume a role that is more than just that of a facilitator, tending toward a type of composer in and of itself. This intersection of the system and my own intentions is a rich territory of exploration in which new ideas are discovered, proliferated and developed in novel ways. As of 2017, I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Alex Harker](http://www.alexanderjharker.co.uk) and [Steven Jan](https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/persons/steven-jan) at the University of Huddersfield.
