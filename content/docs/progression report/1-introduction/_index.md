# Introduction
This progression report will outline the development of my PhD research throughout 2018 and 2019. This year has generated a significant amount of momentum personally and professionally, demonstrated in the shifts in my practice as an artist-programmer. In order to engage with and outline the major developments in both theory and practice, I have structured this document into three major sections. First, I present a somewhat informal and synchronic narrative demonstrating how my interests, social circumstances and overall motivations have evolved since the inception of the project. In doing this, I hope to provide some useful, honest insight into how and why my artistic interests have changed. Second, I outline the development of my research questions and provide a snapshot of how my methodology is forming to answer them. Finally, I provide commentary on current works and give some insight into where I think the research is heading in future.
