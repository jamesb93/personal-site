# consulting
---

I offer consulting on a range of creative coding topics. In the past I have worked with artists to help them build instruments, installations or advise them on big picture aspects of incorporating technology into creative practice.

## Past Projects

### [Song Sketch](https://xystudiotools.com/pages/about-song-sketch) | Rapid sketching of songs in Ableton using Max for Live

### [Andie Brown](https://andiebrownsound.com) | Harmonic processing instruments

In 2020 I built a series of Max-based instruments for Andie that focused on methods of harmonic analysis, processing and synthesis. The end result was a set of modular abstractions that could be also be used as bpatchers in an existing monolithic performance patch.

### [Griet Bayaert](http://www.grietbglass.com) | Installation consulting

I worked with Griet over a long period of time, first helping her integrate a series of Arduino powered LED lights into an installation. The Arduino acted as an interface between Max and the lights so that the activity of the lights could be mapped to sonic features and analysis of installation attendees movements throughout the installation space.

In another project I consulted on digital signal processing best practices in Max to help Griet establish a practice in this area and to give her the tools to build bespoke systems for a installation/performance.
