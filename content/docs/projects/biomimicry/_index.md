# Biomimicry

Biomimicry is an autonomous musical system that observes an improviser using audio descriptors to synthesise a sound response. Analysing [mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) the system is imbued with an evaluative capability and assesses changes in amplitude and timbre in order to shape its interactive behaviour. At its heart, the system is designed to be cohesive and unified with its human counterpart but at times its digital memory fails and the system’s sensibility emerges. Biomimicry is released as five distinct physical copies each containing a unique instance of the system. In this digital release, you have access to all of those versions and can fully observe the depth and variety of interactive connections that were created between various performers and the system.

Two select outputs from this system can be found on the [music](/docs/music) page. Alternatively you can listen from the [bandcamp](https://tonelist.bandcamp.com/album/biomimicry[) link below, which belongs to [Tone List](http://www.tonelist.com.au).

I also wrote a more [comprehensive article](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/bbp2372.2017.027/1/--biomimicry-analysis-of-a-corpus-based-interactive?page=root;size=150;view=pdf) for the 2017 ICMC in Shanghai.
